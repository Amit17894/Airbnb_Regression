# Airbnb_Regression

##### The primary objective of this project is to develop a regression model that predicts the price of an Airbnb listing. Using features such as property type, room type, number of reviews, location, and amenities, the model will aim to estimate the price accurately.
##### The insights derived from this analysis will help Airbnb hosts understand the key drivers of price, enabling them to make data-driven decisions for pricing their properties. Additionally, the project will help Airbnb refine its recommendations for pricing to improve host and guest satisfaction
